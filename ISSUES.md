## PowerShell Module Critique & Practical Improvement Tips

### General Observations
- **Documentation**: The module has good use of comment-based help, but some functions have incomplete or missing parameter documentation. Ensure every parameter is described, including pipeline and clipboard behavior.
- **Consistency**: There are minor inconsistencies in naming conventions (e.g., some test files use `It` vs `Pester\It`). Standardize on one style for clarity.
- **Testing**: Pester tests are present for most functions, but some tests are minimal and only check PSScriptAnalyzer compliance. Add more functional and edge-case tests for robust coverage.
- **Error Handling**: Many scripts lack explicit error handling. Use `try/catch` blocks and provide user-friendly error messages, especially for file operations and AI service calls.
- **Parameter Validation**: Use `[ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]` and `[ValidateSet()]` where appropriate to prevent invalid input.
- **Pipeline Support**: Most functions claim pipeline support, but ensure all parameters that accept pipeline input are properly decorated and tested.
- **Performance**: For batch operations (e.g., `Update-AllImageMetaData`), consider parallelization or progress reporting for large datasets.
- **Security**: If any function interacts with external services or files, validate inputs to prevent injection or path traversal vulnerabilities.
- **Alias Management**: Follow the strict alias rules in your copilot-instructions. Never add aliases unless explicitly required.
- **Changelog Discipline**: After changes, always update and empty `change-log.md` for professional commit messages.

### Practical Tips
- **Expand Unit Tests**: Go beyond analyzer checks. Add tests for expected output, error conditions, and edge cases.
- **Improve Error Feedback**: Use `Write-Error` or `throw` with clear messages. Consider a common error handling utility for the module.
- **Parameter Documentation**: Ensure every parameter in every function is documented, including pipeline and clipboard support.
- **Session vs Persistent Settings**: Make it clear in help and code when a setting is session-only vs persistent.
- **Leverage PowerShell Best Practices**: Use `CmdletBinding()`, `SupportsShouldProcess`, and `ConfirmImpact` where appropriate.
- **Optimize Data Processing**: For functions that process large collections, use `ForEach-Object -Parallel` (PowerShell 7+) or background jobs.
- **Security Review**: Review all file and external service interactions for security best practices.
