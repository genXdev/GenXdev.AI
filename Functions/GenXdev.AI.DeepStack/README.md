Find-IndexedImage -HasNudity -HasExplicitContent -ShowInBrowser -InterActive

# you can keep the output and reuse them
$foundImages = Find-IndexedImage -HasNudity -HasExplicitContent

# all Find-IndexedImage's parameters, except -PathLike, are inclusive
# to truly filter using exclusions, chain commands using pipes |
