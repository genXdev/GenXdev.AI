<#
.SYNOPSIS
Terminates all running ComfyUI processes and releases associated resources.

.DESCRIPTION
Safely stops all processes related to ComfyUI by identifying processes with
the name 'comfyui'. This function is used to clean up ComfyUI processes after
image generation or when a forced shutdown is requested. It provides verbose
feedback for debugging and handles cases where no ComfyUI processes are
running.

.EXAMPLE
Stop-ComfyUI -Verbose
Terminates ComfyUI processes with detailed output for debugging.

.NOTES
This function is designed to be called by other ComfyUI-related cmdlets, such
as Invoke-ComfyUIImageGeneration, particularly when the -Force parameter is used or
when -KeepComfyUIRunning is not specified. It uses PowerShell's process
management to ensure clean termination without leaving orphaned processes.
