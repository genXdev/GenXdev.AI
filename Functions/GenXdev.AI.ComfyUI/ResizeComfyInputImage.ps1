.SYNOPSIS
Resizes input image while preserving aspect ratio for optimal processing.

.DESCRIPTION
Intelligently resizes input images to fit within specified maximum dimensions
while maintaining the original aspect ratio and visual quality. This function
is essential for ComfyUI processing optimization, as it ensures images are
appropriately sized for AI model processing without causing memory issues or
performance degradation.

The function uses high-quality bicubic interpolation for resizing and creates
temporary files for processed images. It automatically detects when resizing
is unnecessary and returns the original path to avoid redundant operations.
The resizing algorithm intelligently determines scaling based on image
orientation (landscape vs portrait) for optimal dimension utilization.

.PARAMETER ImagePath
Path to the input image file to resize. Must be a valid image file that
System.Drawing can load. The original file is never modified; a temporary
resized copy is created when needed.

.PARAMETER MaxWidth
Maximum width in pixels for the resized image. The function ensures the
output image width does not exceed this value while maintaining aspect ratio.
Default value is optimized for balanced processing performance.

.PARAMETER MaxHeight
Maximum height in pixels for the resized image. The function ensures the
output image height does not exceed this value while maintaining aspect ratio.
Default value is optimized for balanced processing performance.

.EXAMPLE
$resizedPath = ResizeComfyInputImage -ImagePath "large_photo.jpg" `
    -MaxWidth 1024 -MaxHeight 1024
Resize a large image to fit within 1024x1024 bounds for GPU processing.

.EXAMPLE
$tempImage = ResizeComfyInputImage "portrait.png" 800 600
Resize using positional parameters for CPU-optimized dimensions.

.EXAMPLE
"input.jpg" | ResizeComfyInputImage -MaxWidth 512 -MaxHeight 512
Resize via pipeline for smaller, faster processing.

.NOTES
This function uses System.Drawing.Graphics with HighQualityBicubic
interpolation to ensure the best possible image quality during resizing.
Temporary files are created in the system temp directory and should be
cleaned up by calling functions after use.

The function automatically detects when resizing is unnecessary based on
current image dimensions and returns the original path unchanged to optimize
performance and avoid redundant file operations.
