.SYNOPSIS
Sets ComfyUI processes to IDLE priority for CPU mode processing optimization.

.DESCRIPTION
Intelligently locates ComfyUI-related processes and sets their priority to IDLE
to prevent system performance impact during CPU-based image generation. This
function is essential for maintaining system responsiveness during long-running
AI generation tasks that can otherwise consume all available CPU resources.

The function uses multiple detection strategies to identify ComfyUI processes,
including direct process name matching, Python processes with ComfyUI window
titles, and command-line analysis. It only operates in CPU mode to avoid
interfering with GPU-optimized processing where maximum CPU priority may be
beneficial for coordination tasks.

.PARAMETER UseGPU
Flag indicating GPU processing mode. When true, the function returns
immediately without modifying process priorities since GPU mode typically
benefits from normal CPU priority for coordination and data transfer tasks.

.EXAMPLE
SetComfyUIProcessPriority
Sets all ComfyUI processes to IDLE priority for CPU-friendly processing.

.EXAMPLE
SetComfyUIProcessPriority -UseGPU
Skips priority adjustment since GPU mode is active.

.NOTES
This function requires appropriate permissions to modify process priorities.
The IDLE priority class allows ComfyUI to run in the background without
impacting interactive applications or system responsiveness.

The function silently continues if any process priority cannot be modified,
ensuring robust operation even with permission limitations or process
access restrictions.
